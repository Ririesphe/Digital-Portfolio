- **REFLECTION: STAR TECHNIQUE**
  
Situation:
During the Work Readiness training, I completed the Business Communication module, which focused on professional communication, email etiquette, non-verbal communication, and appropriate workplace language.

Task:
My goal was to demonstrate a strong understanding of how to communicate effectively in a professional environment, both verbally and in writing. I aimed to apply these skills to future workplace interactions, such as meetings, presentations, and emails.

Action:
I carefully studied each topic, practiced identifying examples of verbal and non-verbal communication, and learned the correct tone and structure for formal business emails. I also reviewed the importance of maintaining professionalism during virtual meetings by using proper backgrounds and clear, respectful communication.

Result:
I achieved a final mark of 100%, showing a complete understanding of business communication principles. This experience strengthened my ability to express ideas clearly and respectfully in a professional setting. I now feel confident in writing formal messages, participating in meetings, and adapting my communication style to suit different audiences.
